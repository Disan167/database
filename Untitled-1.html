4. Updating the Progress Bar Based on Expenses
To calculate the progress bar dynamically, you would need to:

Calculate the total expenses in each category.
Compare it with the budget amount to determine the percentage.
For example, you can write a query to get the total expenses in each category and then calculate the percentage for the progress bar:

This code assumes that you have an expenses table where expenses are stored, and you can group them by category to get the total expenses in each category.
If you don't have an expenses table yet, this would need to be set up first
